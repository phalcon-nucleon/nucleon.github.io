  <h1>Error Handling</h1>
  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>When you start a new Nucleon project, error and exception handling is already configured for you. The
    <code>App\Exceptions\Handler</code> class is where all exceptions triggered by your application are logged and
    then rendered back to the user. We'll dive deeper into this class throughout this documentation.</p>
  <h2>Configuration</h2>
  <p>The <code>debug</code> option in your <code>.const.ini</code> configuration file determines how much information
    about an error is actually displayed to the user.</p>

  <p>For local development, you should set the APP_DEBUG environment variable to true. In your production environment,
    this value should always be false. If the value is set to true in production, you risk exposing sensitive
    configuration values to your application's end users.</p>
  <h2>The Exception Handler</h2>
  <p>All exceptions are handled by the <code>App\Exceptions\Handler</code> class.
    This class contains two methods: <code>report</code> and <code>render</code>.
    We'll examine each of these methods in detail.</p>
  <h3><code>report</code> method</h3>
  <p>The <code>report</code> method is used to log exceptions. By default,
    the <code>report</code> method passes the exception to the base class where the exception is logged. However, you
    are free to log
    exceptions however you wish.</p>
  <p>
    For example, if you need to report different types of exceptions in different ways, you may use the PHP <code>instanceof</code>
    comparison operator:
  </p>
  <pre><code>/**
 * Report or log an exception.
 *
 * This is a great spot to send exceptions to Sentry, Bugsnag, etc.
 *
 * @param  \Exception|\Throwable $throwable
 * @return void
 */
public function report($throwable)
{
    if ($throwable instanceof CustomException) {
        // don't log
        return;
    }
    if ($throwable instanceof CustomException) {
        //
    }

    parent::report($throwable);
}</code></pre>

  <h3><code>render</code> method</h3>
  <p>The <code>render</code> method is responsible for converting a given exception into an HTTP response that should be
    sent back to
    the browser. By default, the exception is passed to the base class which generates a response for you. However, you
    are free to check the exception type or return your own custom response:</p>

  <pre><code>/**
 * Render any exception/error, in Web context.
 *
 * Only fateful exception/error will may be rendered.
 *
 * @param \Exception|\Throwable          $throwable
 * @param \Phalcon\Http\RequestInterface $request
 *
 * @return \Phalcon\Http\ResponseInterface
 */
public function render($throwable, $request = null)
{
    if ($throwable instanceof CustomException) {
        return (new Response)->redirect('index');
    }

    return parent::render($throwable, $request);
}</code></pre>
  <h3><code>renderConsole</code> method</h3>
  <p>The <code>render</code> method is responsible for converting a given exception into an cli response that should be
    sent back to
    the console. By default, the exception is passed to the base class which generates a response for you. However, you
    are free to check the exception type or return your own custom response:</p>
  <pre><code>/**
 * Render any exception/error, in Cli context.
 *
 * Fateful and not fateful exception/error will may be reported.
 *
 * @param \Exception|\Throwable $throwable
 */
public function renderConsole($throwable)
{
    parent::renderConsole($throwable);
}</code></pre>
